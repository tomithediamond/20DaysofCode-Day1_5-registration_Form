REGISTRATION FORM

For Days 1- 5 of the #20DaysofCode challenge at HerTechTrail academy, we were asked to Build  a registration form using CSS and HTML. Below is how I arrived at the final outlook: 

Day 1- Build structure of page using HTML
I used HTML tags, elements, id, etc. to build the basic structure of my form page. 

Day 2 & 3- Style page using CSS
I applied CSS elements and function to the previously structured page for the purpose of style and formatting. Some of the CSS functions used include border, margin, padding, background color, display, etc. 

Day 4- Implement responsiveness
I further used CSS to implement responsiveness. This means that my page will automatically adjust to fit the screensize of whatever device it is viewed on. 

Day 5- Host the page
You are reading this because I have followed all the instructions of the chalenge, the last of which is to host my page. For this, I used Github Pages.


CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED
While carrying out this task, my main challenge was applying the right CSS elements to ensure that it looks exactly like the reference registration form.
